# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study compares the performance of two legal classifications of sustainable use areas in Brazil in terms of their ability to slow forest clearing. A primary difference between these areas is whether they were established through a top-down or bottom-up process.

Research in both the conservation and development literatures suggests that sustainable development projects are more likely to succeed, or perhaps only likely to succeed, if they are a result of local policy initiative rather than a top-down imposition by outsiders. However, especially in the environmental sphere, there is not enough research directly evaluating this claim or attempting to estimate how much more effective these bottom-up efforts really are. To provide some evidence on this issue, I turn to a sample of sustainable-use conservation areas in Brazil that differ in very few ways except that one classification tends to be formed through a bottom-up local petition process (RESEX areas) while the other tends to be formed through a top-down process (SDR areas; and there are some exceptions). I use a fixed-effects model to illustrate that the sustainable use areas established through a bottom-up process do indeed appear to have been more effective at limiting increases in forest clearing. However, this difference is only substantially noteworthy among a subset of these areas that are already facing a higher risk of forest clearing.
