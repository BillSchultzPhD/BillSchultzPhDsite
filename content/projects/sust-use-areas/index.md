# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study compares the performance of a sample of mixed use protected areas in Brazil (in terms of fire prevention) based on whether they were created in a top-down manner, or whether they were created in response to local policy initiative.

Research in both the conservation and development literatures suggests that interventions are less likely to succeed when they are imposed in a top-down manner. There are strong normative arguments for prioritizing policy interventions that have been developed in response to local policy initiative. However, it is difficult to provide reliable empirical evidence on how doing so might influence an interventionâ€™s effectiveness, given the many possibly spurious differences between bottom-up and top-down policy interventions. In this study, I identify a sample of mixed use protected areas in Brazil that are otherwise similar, but vary in terms of whether they were created in a top-down manner, or whether they were created in response to articulated community demands for ecosystem protection. I use several estimation strategies to explore whether 0.25 square-kilometer parcels of protected land in these top-down protected areas were more likely to experience forest fires between 2015 and 2020. The findings of these analyses help further our understanding of the relationship between various dimensions of community participation in policymaking and the subsequent outcomes.
