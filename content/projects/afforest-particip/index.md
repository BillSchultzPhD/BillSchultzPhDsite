Forest restoration is widely recognized as a global priority to sequester carbon, conserve biodiversity, and to support the livelihoods of rural and indigenous people. Policymakers and scholars regularly call for stakeholder participation in restoration initiatives; however, there remains limited evidence of how this shapes outcomes over longer time horizons. Using a unique dataset of four decades’ tree planting in North India, we find that substantive local influence over project planning and continued management – in short, long-term empowered local governance – is associated with greater livelihood benefits and improvements in forest canopy cover. Empowered local governance may support interventions that better align with local priorities, thus sustaining local management over time. Our work implies the need to move beyond project-based interventions to create supportive conditions for empowered local governance over the long-term. A paradigm of “people-centered restoration” may offer the best opportunity to support human and environmental goals in rural landscapes of the global south.
