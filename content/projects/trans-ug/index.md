# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We provide experimental evidence that while multi-stakeholder forums increased transparency surrounding the oil sector in Western Uganda, they did not change how communities assign blame and credit to key policymakers.

Does transparency in the extractives sector influence how communities assign blame and credit to policymakers? If it does not, this undermines the purported downstream benefits of transparency, like improving accountability. To explore the effects of transparency on blame and credit, we analyze data from a field experiment conducted by a not-for-profit working on stakeholder engagement in the oil-sector in Western Uganda. We show that participation in multi-stakeholder forums improves transparency, and then examine whether it also changes how communities assign blame and credit across seven oil-sector policymakers. We find that the distribution of blame and credit does not change after transparency improves. On average, communities blame the same actors in roughly the same proportion as when transparency was lower. Our research highlights an explanation for the struggles of high-profile transparency initiatives that is due more attention from researchers and practitioners.
