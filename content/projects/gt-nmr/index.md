# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: How should analysts expect third-party agencies to behave when the success of a payment-based policy intervention requires devoting effort to costly relationship-building or risky local partnerships? This study uses game theory to explore the answers to that question

Payments for ecosystem services (PES) projects, and other efforts like them, often cannot afford to compensate citizens for their entire opportunity cost of cooperating with a project. While research shows that non-monetary returns to contribution (i.e., a "warm glow" people feel for engaging in pro-social behavior) can help fill this gap, the strategic dynamics underlying a developer's choice to invest in establishing non-monetary returns or not remain unclear. I build on recent PES games to explore this issue. Among other things, I show that an interest in limiting costs can give development agencies an incentive to treat non-monetary returns and payments as substitutes rather than complements as intended. I also explore how a threat of elite capture influences an agency's decision-making.
