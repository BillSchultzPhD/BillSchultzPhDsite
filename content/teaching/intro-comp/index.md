This course exposes undergraduate students to current state of research on Comparative Politics. It focuses on: (1) reviewing the major questions researchers in this subfield explore; and (2) giving students a basic primer on the philsophy of science and the methodological tools used by researchers in Comparative Politics today. I draw on Clark, Golder and Golder’s textbook, “Principles of Comparative Politics” when teaching this course.
