I'm a social scientist interested in natural resource management around the world and associated equity issues. I'm especially interested in work evaluating the impacts of environmental interventions or exploring community participation in policymaking. Methodologically, I'm most interested in causal inference and debates about how analysts should draw conclusions based on statistical evidence. My own research incorporates a flexible mix of game theory, correlational analysis, quasi-experimental analysis, and experimentation.

I currently hold a position as an Associate Scholar with Florida State University, and spend some of my time working for the General Service Administration's Office of Evaluation Sciences as a Data Scientist. On this website, you will find some information about my personal research, courses I've taught in the past, and my CV. Thank you for visiting!
