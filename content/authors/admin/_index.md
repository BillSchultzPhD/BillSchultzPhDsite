I research natural resource management in societies around the world, as well as the politics of conservation and development projects. I conduct my research using a flexible mix of game theory and observational data analysis. I am especially interested in geospatial data collection and causal inference.

On this website, you will find some information about my research projects (including replication materials), the courses I teach, and my CV. You can also get in touch over email. Thank you for visiting!
