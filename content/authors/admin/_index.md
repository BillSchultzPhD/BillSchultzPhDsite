I'm a social scientist interested in equity issues and natural resource management around the world. I'm especially interested in work evaluating the impacts of environmental and development interventions, or work exploring community participation in policymaking. Methodologically, I'm most interested in geospatial data collection, causal inference, and debates about how researchers and policymakers should draw conclusions based on data. My own research incorporates a flexible mix of game theory, correlational analysis, quasi-experimental analysis, and experimentation.

On this website, you will find some information about my research, courses I have taught, and my CV. Thank you for visiting!
