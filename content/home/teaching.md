## Introduction to Comparative Politics

This course exposures undergraduate students to the current state of research into the politics of natural resource management around the world today, embedded within a broader tradition of research in the subfield of Comparative Politics. Students in this course read and discuss academic articles on resource management dilemmas at both micro (individual households and towns) and macro levels (countries, or regions within a country). Students are exposed to the relative methodological advantages of both qualitative and quantitative efforts.
